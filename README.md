1.	How do I approach designing software?
This project has helped me craft my planning skills. Prior to this project, it was often that I would just start working without a clear-cut plan. This project had me know exactly what my goal is and the steps to get there beforehand. Applying proper planning to future projects will be greatly beneficial to my project’s success.
2.	How do I approach developing software?
While it is not a new development tactic, this is the first time that I have truly applied an iterative process to a project. One iteration tactic that I used in my approach was making minor changes to functions, then running to make sure it works. Then if I needed to know more about how it worked, I would make a small change again to see the consequence. Every time a new module came around and more things were added, I would go back and adjust existing code as needed. 
3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Overall, this course on computational graphics and visualizations has provided knowledge that can help as I continue my education and entering a professional pathway. This course specifically strengthened my understanding of matrices, header files, and object structures. All of which I will need to have a strong foundation of to continue to grow my skill set.
